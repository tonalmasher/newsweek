# newsweek recreation

I recreated the cover page of Newsweek in the week of December 4th, 2017 as part of the Odin Project's HTML curriculum.

The CSS is based on Boostrap 4 (Beta).  But, I had to use a lot of custom CSS to modify elements, and plan to look into the use of SASS to access the Bootstrap variables for future projects.
